# Mutual information of the M-ary testing problem and its convexity (KL) bound

Consider the $M$-ary testing problem: an index $J$ is drawn uniformly from $\{1,\dots,M\}$, and one
observes $Z \sim P_{\theta^J}$. The **mutual information** $I(Z; J)$ measures how much the observation
reveals about the index. It is defined as the Kullback–Leibler divergence between the joint law of
$(Z, J)$ and the product of its marginals,
$$ I(Z; J) = D\!\left(\mathbb{Q}_{Z,J} \,\big\|\, \mathbb{Q}_Z \otimes \mathbb{Q}_J\right), $$
which equals the average KL divergence between each component and the uniform mixture,
$$ I(Z; J) = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{j=1}^{M} D\!\left(P_{\theta^j} \,\big\|\, \bar Q\right),
\qquad \bar Q = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{j=1}^{M} P_{\theta^j}. $$
We take this averaged form as the definition (it is the expression used in the lower bounds) and
prove the convexity upper bound
$$ I(Z; J) \le \frac{1}{M^2} \sum_{j=1}^{M} \sum_{k=1}^{M}
   D\!\left(P_{\theta^j} \,\big\|\, P_{\theta^k}\right), $$
which controls the mutual information by the pairwise KL divergences and is the key ingredient for
local-packing minimax lower bounds.

**Reference.** M. J. Wainwright, *High-Dimensional Statistics: A Non-Asymptotic Viewpoint*,
Cambridge University Press, 2019. Chapter 15 (Minimax Lower Bounds), §15.3.1 and §15.3.3
(Bounds based on local packings), Eq. (15.29), (15.30) (definition) and Eq. (15.34) (convexity bound).

**Proof formalization notes.** The mutual information is *defined* here directly in its averaged
form (Eq. (15.30)), `I(Z; J) = (1/M) Σⱼ D(P_{θʲ} ‖ Q̄)`, rather than via the joint-vs-product KL
divergence (Eq. (15.29)); the two are equal, and the averaged form is what the bounds consume.
The convexity bound (Eq. (15.34)) is obtained from convexity of the KL divergence in its second
argument: `D(Q j ‖ Q̄) ≤ (1/M) Σₖ D(Q j ‖ Q k)` (lemma `klDiv_le_avg`), summed over `j`. Since
Mathlib does not package the joint convexity of `klDiv`, that lemma is proved from scratch: the
non-absolutely-continuous case gives an infinite right-hand side; the absolutely-continuous case
reduces, via `klDiv_eq_lintegral_klFun_of_ac` against the reference `mixture Q` and the
Radon–Nikodym chain rule `Measure.rnDeriv_mul_rnDeriv`, to the pointwise real inequality
`klFun_le_avg_real`. The latter is the analytic heart — the perspective `(p, q) ↦ q · klFun(p/q)`
is jointly convex — and, after expanding `klFun x = x log x + 1 - x`, follows from concavity of
`log` (`Real.strictConcaveOn_log_Ioi`) via Jensen's inequality.

**Bibliographic comments.** Mutual information originates with C. E. Shannon, "A Mathematical
Theory of Communication," *Bell System Technical Journal* **27** (1948), 379–423 and 623–656, where
it appears (in the entropy form `H(Z) - H(Z|J)`, equivalent to the KL form above) as the channel
information rate. The convexity (KL) bound stated here is textbook synthesis / folklore: it is the
standard "convexity of KL in the second argument" step underlying the local Fano / Hasminskii
(1978) local-packing minimax machinery (the global metric-entropy method of Yang–Barron, 1999,
belongs to Wainwright §15.3.5 and is not what Eq. (15.34) is), and has no single seminal origin
beyond the joint convexity of the KL divergence
itself. We follow Wainwright's presentation (Eq. (15.34)).

`B k ≥ 0` summing to `M`, and any `D k` with `D k · B k = A` (so `D k = A / B k` where `B k > 0`),
the value `klFun A` is bounded by the `B`-average of `klFun (D k)`:
`klFun A ≤ (1/M) Σₖ B k · klFun (D k)`. This is the real-analytic heart of the second-argument

/-- **Convexity of the KL divergence in its second argument** (Jensen): the divergence from a
fixed component `Q j` to the uniform mixture `Q̄ = (1/M) Σₖ Q k` is at most the average of the
divergences to the components, `D(Q j ‖ Q̄) ≤ (1/M) Σₖ D(Q j ‖ Q k)`. This is the analytic core of
Wainwright Eq. (15.34); it follows from the joint convexity of `(p, q) ↦ q · klFun(p/q)` (the
perspective of the strictly convex `klFun`), which Mathlib does not yet package for `klDiv`.

The non-absolutely-continuous case is discharged here (the right-hand side is `∞`); the remaining
absolutely-continuous case reduces, via `klDiv_eq_lintegral_klFun_of_ac` against the reference
`mixture Q` and the Radon–Nikodym chain rule `Measure.rnDeriv_mul_rnDeriv`, to the pointwise bound
`klFun_le_avg_real` integrated over `mixture Q`. -/
